## Overview

This testing framework is designed for automating web applications, functioning as a reusable and structured test suite with:
- **BDD Style Scenarios**: Test actions and verifications are combined into clear, descriptive test cases.
- **Page Object Implementation**: Centralized page methods for UI interactions, reducing test redundancy and ensuring high reusability.
- **Test Automation for E-Commerce Flow**: Built to validate login functionality, product interactions, and inventory management.

---

## Features

- **Automated Login Tests**:
  - Navigate to the login page and perform user authentication with valid credentials.
- **Inventory Functionality**:
  - Add or remove items from the cart dynamically and validate button states.
- **Product Page Operations**:
  - Verify product details such as name and price.
  - Toggle cart state (e.g., add/remove products in detail view).
- **TestNG for Validation**:
  - Test assertions to ensure UI components behave as expected.
  - Configured preconditions and reusable base methods.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: Programming language.
- **Selenium WebDriver**: Browser automation.
- **TestNG**: Test framework for execution and assertions.
- **Gradle**: Build and dependency management tool.
- **Page Object Model (POM)**: Design pattern to separate test logic and UI interactions.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before you clone the project, ensure the following are installed and configured on your local machine:

1. **Java Development Kit (JDK)** (Version 8 or higher)
2. **Gradle** (for dependency and build management)
3. **Browser Drivers**:
   - Download the appropriate WebDriver (e.g., ChromeDriver for Chrome, GeckoDriver for Firefox).
   - Ensure the WebDriver executable is present in your `PATH`.

### Steps to Set Up

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd JAVA_POM_SELENIUM
   ```

2. Install project dependencies:

   ```bash
   gradle clean build
   ```

## Running the Tests

### Execute Tests using TestNG

1. Open the project in **IntelliJ IDEA**.
2. Right-click a test class (e.g., `TS02_Inventory.java`) or individual test cases.
3. Select **Run** to initiate execution.

### Execute Using Gradle

Run all test cases using the following command:

```bash
gradle test
```

### Test Results

Upon completion, test results will be available in:

## Example Test Scenarios

Below are some key test cases implemented in the project:

1. **TS0201_AddItemToCart**
   - Log in with a valid user.
   - Add a product to the cart via the inventory page.
   - Validate the button state changes to "Remove".

   **Method**:
   ```java
   @Test
   public void TS0201_AddItemToCart() {
       InventoryPage inventoryPage = LoginPrecondition();
       int index = inventoryPage.clickButtonAddToCart();
       Assert.assertTrue(inventoryPage.verifyIsButtonItemInRemoveState(index));
   }
   ```

2. **TS0202_RemoveItemFromCart**
   - Log in as a user.
   - Add multiple items to the cart and remove one.
   - Assert the button returns to the "Add to Cart" state.

3. **TS0203_SeeProductDetail**
   - Add a product on the inventory page.
   - Navigate to the product details page.
   - Assert the product name and price match those on the inventory list.

4. **TS0204_ToggleButtonAddToCartInsideDetailProduct**
   - Access the product detail page.
   - Perform actions like toggling "Add to Cart" and verify state consistency.
